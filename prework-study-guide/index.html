          <ul>
            <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage with CSS, incline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. External CSS style sheet is the most common.</li>
            <li>CSS styling uses "CSS rules" which groups CSS properties that will be applied to the HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Each CSS rule includes a selector (which defines the element that the rules will be applied to) and a declaration (comprised of 2 important CSS components: the desired CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property) or declaration block for multiple declarations.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A border creates a border around the element.</li>
            <li>A box shadow adds a shadow effect around the element's frame</li>
            <li>A Class Attribute allows the user to share a specific CSS rule to any element of their choosing, by way of a class selector.</li>

            <li>git add: adds a change in the current working directory to the staging area, or what the user wants to add to the next commit</li>
            <li>git commit: saves the file and leaves a snapshot or checkpoint for the user to refer back to; tip: it's a good idea to use "git commit -m" to add a commit message stating what was changed</li>
