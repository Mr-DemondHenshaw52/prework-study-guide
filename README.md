# Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description
This is a brief informative Prework study guide created to assist incoming and new bootcamp students! This guide contains quick information about HTML, Git, CSS, and Javascript. I personally believe each tid-bit of information included in this study guide is more than helpful to anyone wanting to learn coding, as these same pieces of information helped further my knowledge.

## Installation

No installation required!

## Usage

To properly access and utilize this study guide, simply read the notes in each section, at your own pace and leisure. If you are unsure where to start or want a bit more guidance, feel free to use Chrome DevTools to view an interactive console panel with an included suggestion on which topic to study first! You can access this console panel by either right-clicking anywhere on the screen and clicking 'Inspect Element', followed by clicking the console tab or by using the shortcuts: ctrl + shift + I (If you're using Windows) & Command + Option + I (If you're using macOS). Good luck and happy learning!
